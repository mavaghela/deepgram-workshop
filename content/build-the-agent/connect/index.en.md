title: "Step 2: Connect"
weight: 22

**Goal:** Open a WebSocket to the Voice Agent API, describe the agent you want, and confirm the server accepted it.

**You'll learn**

- How one `AgentV1Settings` object configures listening, thinking, and speaking
- Why the settings handshake has to complete before you send a single byte of audio
- How to write a message handler that survives events Deepgram hasn't shipped yet

## Start here

This folder runs as-is, nothing from Step 1 carries forward; that was a diagnostic. The agent program starts here.

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=false}
uv run steps/02-connect/main.py
:::

A page opens with a **Connect** button. Press it and you get `>> Connection opened` in the terminal, a handshake is initiated but nothing happens. The settings go out and nothing catches the replies.

You'll continue by adding the orchestration that happens after the handshake is finished.

## The mental model

A traditional voice pipeline means three services and the glue between them: speech-to-text, an LLM, text-to-speech. You own the orchestration, the buffering, and every millisecond of latency between the hops.

The Voice Agent API collapses that into one WebSocket. You describe all three components in a single settings message, and Deepgram runs the pipeline server-side. Read `SETTINGS` in `main.py`, because it's the most important thing in the file:

- **`listen`**: Flux, Deepgram's conversational speech-to-text model. Turn detection lives *inside* the model, which is why you'll never write voice activity detection in this workshop.
- **`think`**: the LLM. `gpt-4o-mini` here, which Deepgram brokers, so your Deepgram key covers it. In Step 6 this is the setting that moves to Amazon Bedrock.
- **`speak`**: Flux TTS. The `flux-` prefix routes to Deepgram's v2 Speak backend automatically.
- **`greeting`**: what the agent says first, which Deepgram adds to the conversation history so the LLM knows it already said it.

Every step in this workshop either adds to that object or reacts to what it produces.

### Where the browser fits

The browser is used to make the microphone and speakers easy to access during the workshop. Your `main.py` never touches a microphone, a speaker, or a socket. It hands two things to `bridge.run()`: the agent you want, and a function to call when the agent says something. The shared code in [`web/`](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-workshop-py/tree/main/web) does the rest.

The bridge hides plumbing, never concepts, and connecting to a voice agent is your main takeaway from this workshop. Opening the socket is not the same as being connected. A session is a handshake with a gate in the middle: you describe the agent you want, Deepgram confirms it accepted that description, and only after the confirmation does audio mean anything.

Open [`web/session.py`](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-workshop-py/blob/main/web/session.py) and find `_run()`.

:::code{language=text showCopyAction=false showLineNumbers=false}
open the socket
  → register handlers         events fire on arrival, so a late handler misses the early ones
  → start the listener        the receive loop blocks until close, so it gets its own thread
  → start the sender          one thread owns every write, and nothing else touches the socket
  → send SETTINGS             the description of the agent you want
  → wait for SettingsApplied  Deepgram accepting it, ten seconds at most
  → the gate opens            the browser is cleared to capture
:::

That last line is the one to carry forward. `SettingsApplied` flips a single flag, and everything that produces audio waits on it: the browser gets a `ready` frame telling it to start capturing, and any chunk that beats the flag is dropped before it reaches your `on_media`. The handshake is what turns an open socket into a running agent.

::::alert{type="info" header="Check yourself"}
Which of the three models does `listen` configure, and where does the LLM get named?

:::expand{header="Answer"}
`listen` configures speech-to-text. The LLM is named under `think`.

## Do this

Work through the TODO blocks in `main.py` in order.

**TODO 2.1: Handle inbound messages.** Write `on_message`. Three details in that handler matter more than they look:

The `isinstance(message, bytes)` check comes first because audio frames are not JSON events and have no `.type` attribute. Reach for one anyway and you get `"Unknown"` thousands of times a minute.

The final `else` prints instead of ignoring. Deepgram adds server events over time, and the fallthrough means new ones surface in your console rather than vanishing silently. You'll rely on that in Step 5.

The signature takes three arguments (`agent`, `player`, `message`) whether you use them or not. `player` starts earning its place in Step 3, `agent` in Step 7.

**TODO 2.2: Hand your agent to the bridge.** `bridge.run(settings=SETTINGS, on_message=on_message)`.

Note what you are *not* passing: `on_media`. Without it the bridge never opens the microphone at all, which is why this step sends no audio, and why the agent hangs up on you.

::::alert{type="info" header="Check yourself"}
The bridge waits for `SettingsApplied` before it lets the browser send audio. Why does that ordering matter?

:::expand{header="Answer"}
The agent discards any media that arrives before the handshake completes, so audio sent early is silently lost.

## Verify

:::code{language=text showCopyAction=false showLineNumbers=false}
>> Connection opened
>> Welcome
Sending agent settings...
>> Settings applied
[assistant] Hello! I'm a Deepgram voice agent. What would you like to talk about?
>> History
>> AgentAudioDone
>> Agent error: CLIENT_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT - ...
>> Connection closed
:::

The agent already spoke. That `[assistant]` line is `ConversationText`, and the audio for it streamed past your handler while you watched, and you just have nowhere to play it yet. It also appears in the transcript on the page, which is the bridge mirroring events for you, not your code.

Notice `>> Welcome` and `>> History` arriving through the fallthrough branch. Neither has an explicit `elif`, and both still showed up. That's the design working.

Expect the `CLIENT_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT` at the end. The agent wants a *continuous* media stream and hangs up after about fifteen seconds of receiving none. Nothing sends audio until Step 4. Worth seeing now so you recognize it later.

::alert[Everyone should see `>> Settings applied` and an `[assistant]` line before moving on. This is the first real milestone, and a failure here is almost always the API key.]{type="info" header="Pause: check in with the instructor"}

## Troubleshooting

:::expand{header="The page says the server timed out applying settings"}
Either a rejected setting or a bad key. Check the terminal for an `Error` message just above it.
:::

:::expand{header="Nothing after >> Connection opened"}
You defined `on_message` but did not pass it to `bridge.run`.
:::

:::expand{header="The Connect button is disabled"}
Read the red box on the page. Almost always a page opened on a LAN address rather than `127.0.0.1`.
:::

:::expand{header="Address already in use"}
An earlier step is still running in another terminal. Stop it, or pass `--port 8001`.
:::

`steps/03-hear-the-agent/main.py` is this step, finished.

## Going further

Change `greeting` to something else and run again. Then delete it entirely: the agent connects and waits silently, which is what you want for an agent that answers rather than opens.

---

Your agent is live and already talking. Next you give the audio somewhere to go, and hear it.
