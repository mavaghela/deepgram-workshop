**Goal:** Route the agent's Flux TTS audio to your speaker and hear the greeting out loud.

**You'll learn**

- Why streaming audio always needs a queue, and who owns it
- The difference between "the agent stopped sending" and "you stopped hearing"
- Why an exception in a message handler ends the entire call

## Start here

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=false}
uv run steps/03-hear-the-agent/main.py
:::

Press **Connect**. Everything from Step 2 works: the agent connects, applies settings, and announces itself in the console. Audio for that greeting is arriving on the socket right now, and the `if isinstance(message, bytes):` block at the top of the message handler is throwing every frame away.

This step gives those audio frames somewhere to go.

## The mental model

Deepgram sends TTS audio as raw PCM frames matching the `output` format you declared in `SETTINGS`: 24 kHz, mono, signed 16-bit. No container, no header, no decoding; the bytes off the socket are already playable samples.

Your handler's second argument, `player`, is where they go. One call:

:::code{language=python showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=false}
player.send(message)
:::

One line, because a queue is already sitting behind it. You rarely write that queue yourself: this bridge ships one, [Deepgram's starter apps](https://github.com/deepgram-starters) ship one, and [Pipecat](https://pipecat.ai) abstracts it completely. Knowing where it lives is what lets you debug it when audio stutters or a reply seems to end early.

Audio arrives from the network in **bursts**: several hundred milliseconds at a time, whenever Flux finishes synthesizing a chunk. Your sound hardware consumes it at a **constant** rate, asking for exactly 128 samples every 5.3 ms and refusing to wait. Something has to absorb that difference, and if it ever runs dry you hear a click.

Open [`web/static/worklets.js`](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-workshop-py/blob/main/web/static/worklets.js) and read `PlaybackProcessor`. Forty lines, and the whole story:

- `this.queue` holds the chunks waiting to be heard.
- `process()` hands the hardware exactly as many samples as it asked for, then fills any shortfall with **silence** rather than stale audio.
- `return true` at the end, unconditionally. Return `false` and the browser garbage-collects the node after one idle quantum, and the next reply has nowhere to go.

That queue is why `AgentAudioDone` does not mean "the agent stopped talking." It means the agent stopped *sending*. A second of speech may still sit in the queue ahead of you. Step 5 is entirely about that gap.

::::alert{type="info" header="Check yourself"}
The bridge waits for the browser's speaker to exist before it opens the Deepgram socket. What would go wrong if it connected first?

:::expand{header="Answer"}
The greeting starts arriving within milliseconds of `SettingsApplied`, and audio with nowhere to go is audio thrown away. The bridge waits for the browser's `start` message before it opens the Deepgram socket for exactly this reason.

## Do this

**TODO 3.1: Play the audio.** The `bytes` block currently drops every audio frame. Hand them to the player instead: `player.send(message)`.

Notice what you are *not* writing: no error handling, no buffering, no device setup. A chunk the speaker cannot play is the bridge's problem. Look at `LocalPlayer.send` in [`web/audio.py`](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-workshop-py/blob/main/web/audio.py) to see the version that does have to care. It catches `PortAudioError` and drops the chunk rather than letting it fly, because that handler runs inside the SDK's receive loop, and that loop wraps everything in a single `try`/`except`. The SDK reports any exception escaping it as `EventType.ERROR` and closes the connection. Dropping one 80 ms chunk beats ending the call.

**TODO 3.2: Narrate the turn.** Give `AgentThinking`, `AgentStartedSpeaking`, and `AgentAudioDone` their own `elif` branches so the console reads like a transcript of what the agent is doing.

`LatencyReport` gets an explicit `pass`. It fires once per turn, and left to the fallthrough it clutters the transcript. You'll revisit this in Step 8 to learn more about latency.

## Verify

You hear the greeting spoken aloud, the transcript appears on the page, and the console shows:

:::code{language=text showCopyAction=false showLineNumbers=false}
>> Settings applied

[assistant] Hello! I'm a Deepgram voice agent. What would you like to talk about?
>> Agent started speaking
>> Agent finished speaking
>> Agent error: CLIENT_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT - ...
>> Connection closed
:::

`>> AgentAudioDone` now reads `>> Agent finished speaking`. Watch when it prints: **before** the audio finishes playing. That is the queue.

Expect the `CLIENT_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT` at the end, and this is the last time you will see it. The agent wants a continuous media stream and this step sends none, so it hangs up after about fifteen seconds. Step 4 fixes that by giving it something to listen to.

::alert[Everyone should hear the greeting out loud. Silent machines need fixing now. Step 4 is much harder to debug when you cannot hear anything.]{type="info" header="Pause: check in with the instructor"}

## Troubleshooting

:::expand{header="Silence, but no errors"}
Check the browser console (F12). Then re-run `uv run steps/01-setup/main.py` and press "Run the audio checks"; the tone test tells you whether the problem is this step or your output device.
:::

:::expand{header="Nothing happens when you press Connect"}
Look for a red box on the page. The most common cause is opening the page on a LAN address rather than `127.0.0.1`; browsers only grant microphone and AudioWorklet access on a secure context.
:::

:::expand{header="Audio plays too fast, too slow, or chipmunk-pitched"}
The page and `SETTINGS` disagree about the sample rate. Both read it from `SAMPLE_RATE`, so this should be impossible; if you see it, check the browser console for a warning about the rate the browser actually gave you.
:::

:::expand{header="Stuttering or crackling"}
You added something slow inside the `bytes` block. It runs on the SDK's receive loop; keep it to the one call.
:::

`steps/04-talk-to-the-agent/main.py` is this step, finished.

## Going further

In `PlaybackProcessor.process`, change the underrun fill from `0` to something audible: repeat the last sample instead of writing silence. Run it and listen to a reply. That buzz is what a naive playback queue sounds like when it runs dry, and it is why the real one writes silence.

You can hear the agent. Now close the loop and let it hear you.
