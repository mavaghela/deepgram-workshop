You built a complete voice agent. It listens on Flux, thinks with a model running where you chose, speaks with Flux TTS, yields the floor when interrupted, calls your Python when it needs something it can't know, and takes its turns on your terms.

## The finished agent

`steps/99-final/main.py` is the completed workshop project: every step applied, nothing left as a TODO.

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=false}
uv run steps/99-final/main.py            # browser handles the audio
uv run steps/99-final/main.py --local    # system mic and speaker, via PortAudio
:::

Use it as the reference implementation when a step of yours doesn't behave, or as the starting point for whatever you build next.

## What's in there

Roughly 300 lines, most of them comments, doing seven things:

| Concern | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| Audio format contract | `SAMPLE_RATE`; the browser reads the rest back from `SETTINGS` |
| Turn detection | `EOT_THRESHOLD`, `EOT_TIMEOUT_MS`, wired into the listen provider |
| Agent definition | `SETTINGS`: listen, think, speak, greeting |
| Client-side functions | `FUNCTIONS`, `FUNCTION_HANDLERS`, `handle_function_call` |
| Inbound events | `on_message` |
| Barge-in | `player.clear()` in the `UserStartedSpeaking` branch |
| Outbound audio | `on_media` |

Notice what is *not* there: no device handling, no resampling, no chunking, no permission prompts. That is all in [`web/`](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-workshop-py/tree/main/web), which every step shares and nobody edits. See [`web/README.md`](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-workshop-py/blob/main/web/README.md) for how it works.

The threading rule the whole design rests on: `on_message` runs on the SDK's receive loop, which is also the thread carrying audio. It may not block. That is why `handle_function_call` looks the way it does, and it holds on both the browser and `--local` paths.

::alert[`steps/99-final/main.py` uses the brokered OpenAI provider, not Bedrock. If you want the finished agent thinking in your own AWS account, copy the `think_settings()` function you wrote in [Step 6 Part 2](/make-it-yours/persona-voice-and-brain) across. It's one function and the `.env` block you already have.]{type="info" header="Carrying Bedrock forward"}

## Where to go from here

**Telephony.** Drop `SAMPLE_RATE` to 8000 and switch encoding to `mulaw` to match what phone networks carry. `main.py` is otherwise unchanged. Replacing `web/` with a Twilio media stream is the real work, and the fact that it *is* replaceable is the point of keeping the audio layer out of the step files.

**Multilingual.** Change the listen model to `flux-general-multi` for automatic language detection, and pass `language_hints` when you know the likely languages. See [language prompting](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/flux/language-prompting).

**Eager end-of-turn.** Add `eager_eot_threshold` (0.3 to 0.9, at or below `eot_threshold`) to start the LLM on a probable turn end and discard the work if the user keeps talking. Lower latency, more LLM calls.

**Keyterms.** Pass `keyterms` to the listen provider to bias recognition toward product names, SKUs, or jargon Flux would otherwise mishear. This is usually the highest-leverage accuracy fix for a domain-specific agent.

**Mid-conversation updates.** The socket accepts more than settings and media. `send_update_prompt` changes instructions without reconnecting, `send_inject_agent_message` makes the agent say something unprompted, and `send_inject_user_message` feeds it text as though the user spoke it, which also makes function calling testable without a microphone.

**Server-side functions.** Set `endpoint` on a `ThinkSettingsV1FunctionsItem` and Deepgram calls your HTTP API directly. No `FunctionCallRequest` reaches your client, which suits functions that don't need local state.

**Conversation context.** `AgentV1SettingsAgent` accepts a `context` with prior messages, so a returning caller can pick up where they left off.

**More of Bedrock.** `think.endpoint` isn't limited to `bedrock-runtime`. Point it at a Bedrock Agent, at a gateway that logs every completion, or at an OpenAI-compatible router in front of several models. Anything that speaks the Chat Completions format works.
